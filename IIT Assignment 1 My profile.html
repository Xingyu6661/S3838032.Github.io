									<h2>Part 2:Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>My interest in IT be derived from my ideal which is design a good game. Last year I have online class in Melbourne. After I finish late year’s courses. I am back in China. Because of Chinese policy, I was quarantined in the hotel for two weeks after arriving in China. During this period, I had no way to contact anyone, I could only play games and listen to music in the hotel room. During this time, I realized about a game from China name called Genshin Impact. This is a game I like very much for these following reasons: I've
loved open map games like Minecraft since I was a child. I also like animation and hope to use mobile phone to play high-quality open map games. Genshin Impact content all of the following requirements. I played Genshin Impact for a long-time during isolation. Then I learned about the game company that made Genshin Impact. This company came from my hometown Shanghai called Mihoyo. It was founded in 2012 by three students of Shanghai Jiao tong University. These three students have worked hard day and night, Let Mihoyo become the most famous game company in China and Genshin Impact is also the best Chinese game. It is also the first Chinese game recognized by the world. One of the founders said a sentence deeply moved me ‘One day I opened up the mobile app store and wanted to play a game, but I didn't find any of the games I wanted to play, so I decided to design a favorite game myself.’ For a university student, this ideal is almost impossible to complete. The three founders face huge amounts of difficult challenges. But they use 8 years to overcame the difficulties and made the best game in China. (After only three months of release, Genshin Impact has won the following honors: 1, iPhone game of the year 2020. 2, Best Android of 2020. 3, Best TapTap game 2020 and many other honors.) After I learned their story, I decided that my ideal job was to design a good game. It was during this period that I became interested in IT. I only have a little IT experience which is during last holiday I learned C++ code for one more month. The reason of I choose RMIT is RMIT's IT courses are very popular. I think I can learn a lot here. I hope to learn as much as possible about information technology during this period such as Programming, understanding information systems, game design and app design.</p>
								<h2>Part 3: Ideal job</h2>
								<p>Description: Game design is a process of designing game content and rules. Good game design can create goals that can arouse player’s enthusiasm customs clearance. There are also some good games that are educational. Such as FGO, many of the characters in this game are adapted from historical figures. When I was playing this game, if I'm interested in the adapted historical figures, I'll go back to find their real history. (So, I learned some books such as Iliad, Arthurian Legend and so on.) The attraction of this position comes from my ideal which is design a world-class game.</p>
								<p>Skill I need: Game design involves several categories: game rules and playing method, visual art, programming, productization, sound effects, screenwriter, game characters, props, scenes and interface. If a group what to design a good game, all of the above elements they need to meet. For me now, mastering programming is the most important thing.</p>
								<p>Skill I have: I don't have the elements I need to design a good game at the moment.</p>
								<p>Learning plan: In the next three years of university. I will try to learn all kinds of popular programming languages. I personally hope to master C++ and Python. I also need
increase understanding of computers and Internet. These are essential knowledge. 9If there are conditions, I will also try to learn some knowledge about design.</p>

								<p class="content">From the result of Myers Briggs Type Indicator Test. It says my type is Advocates. I quite agree with that. I have clear pursuit of my morality. Will strive to pursue my ideal things even it’s really difficult. I will also help the people around me within my ability. I’m very good at understanding other people. But I’m very reluctant to do things that go against my heart. Also, a little introverted, not good at communicating with strangers. If I do something I don’t confidence is, I will not be able to exert my due ability</p>
								<p>Confidence is very important for me. This will also greatly affect me efficiently in my team. When I do something, I will evaluate my ability. When I recognize my ability to do it, I will do it better. If I’m in a team with teammates I familiar, I can become a good advocate. If I am very good at this group works, I can be a team leader. Because these factors can improve my confidence. But if this group work which I’m not good at or make a group with strangers, I may not be able to give full play to my abilities. The reason is when I’m doing something, I’m not confidence about, I will not achieve the desired effect because of tension and other factors.</P>
								<p>When I am organizing a team, I will try my best to choose my teammates with good character. This can ensure a good team order and communication atmosphere. I’m not good at be a leader. So, I hope our group can has a leader. This person better not be me. Because I am good at silent dedication but not good at leading others. But If there is no leadership, I will also play this role.</P>
