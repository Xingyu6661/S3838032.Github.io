								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>My project idea is designing a small game. I am interested in it because of my ideal which is design a good game. And I also think that making game itself is an interesting thing. If I want to design a good game, I should start with designing simple games. This will lay a foundation for my future job. The obstacle I anticipate is technical difficulties. Because of I do not have enough IT and programming knowledge at present. But I think it will be solved in the future.</p>
								<p></p>
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>In recent years, more and more world-class games have been designed around the world. But in China, at the end of 2020. The first world-class game recognized by the world was designed which named Genshin Impact. China has never independently designed a world-class game before Genshin Impact. Because Chinses game industry develops very late, more and more world-class games will be designed after that. I want to go back to China after graduation, and join the team of game designers. And I also have my own favorite type of game, so I hope to design my favorite game according to my preferences and abilities. It’s going to be a very interesting thing.</p>
							<h2>Description</h2
							<p>A game developer named Brandon says: Good game design has these follow elements. (02/17/2020 Brandon Rollins)</p>
							<p>1: A clear objective. This is the most important feature for designing games. Playing good games is like experiencing a different life. So, a well-designed game is like being a person, with a clear goal. We must know what kind of game we are designing, why we design this kind of game, how do we design this game and what kind of people did we design this game for. This will not only help us think from the designer’s point of view, but also from the player’s point of view to design a game.</p>
							<p>2: Constraints A good game should have clear rules. This can not only let the novice get started quickly, but also ensure the fairness of the game. Even the classic old game Snake also has clear rules of the game.</p>
							<p>3: Interactivity A good game can ensure a good interaction between players or between players and the game itself. Such as League of Legends. Players can get to know many kinds of people and even make friends when playing LOL. Not only that, LOL also have very good human-computer interaction experience.</p>
							<p>4: Solve runaway leader problem Even some good games still have runaway leader problem. This will make players who are in a backward in the position in the game lose interest in the game. Such as Dota, there is no doubt that Dota is a world-class game. But because of the high difficulty, novices and people who don’t play it often can’t get a good game experience. This makes it easy for new players to give up playing it before they are familiar with it. Designing a game should avoid this problem. This way can gain more players.</p>
							<p>5: Inertia Good game makes players want to play them all the time. Such as Grand Theft Auto 5. Players will continue to play it even after the clearance of the main plot because of its rich playing methods.</p>
							<p>6: Surprise Most good games have a lot of unpredictability in them. Some games will also arrange small colored eggs for players. Such as in League of Legend, many special champions will trigger special conversation when they meet. This will make players want to explore the game more.</p>
							<p>7: Strategy Strategic games make it easier for players to enjoy. For instance, Uno is a strategic game. Although it’s not complicated to play, the strategic deck still makes this game a choice for many people to play in their free time.</p>
							<p>8: Fun Many people play a game because they think it’s fun. It turns out that good games need to be fun to play, even it’s just made a small group of people think it’s fun. (Such as horror games)</p>
							<p>9: Flavor World-class games generally have their uniqueness. It’s same with most good games. If a game has too many similar games, it’s hard to stand out.</p>
							<p>10: A hook Creating an advertising hook can make players more interested in the game. And stand out from the competition.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h2>Tools and technology</h2
							<p>There are a lot of software for game design in today’s society. Unreal Engine 4 is one of them. UE4’s most unique aspect is its Blueprint system that allows users to rapidly develop complex game logic and entire games without ever interacting with a single piece of code. (10/07/2017 The Art Institutes) Unreal can easily export it across mobile devices.</p>
							<p>The requirement of hardware is a computer equipped with good CPU for example AMD 5600X and Graphics Card for example Nvidia 3060.</p>
							<h2>Skill required</h2
							<p>For me the most needed technology is to learn how to program. When these conditions are met, I can start designing simple games. But if I want to design a good game, I think I still need a team.</p>
							<h2>Outcome</h2
							<p>If the project is successfully, it will strengthen my confidence to continue to design games.</p>
